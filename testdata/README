## Command line testing

The Go package "testscript" is used for testing.  The tests are invoked via
test_test.go, and the test scripts are in testdata/script/*.  The tests rely on
access to the Infoblox WAPI and permissions to configure records in
"seci.rice.edu".  To test all scripts in testdata/script/:

  go test

To test individual scripts:

  go test -run Test/address
  go test -run Test/alias
  go test -run Test/cname
  go test -run Test/disabled
  go test -run Test/mixed
  go test -run Test/host
  go test -run Test/ptr
